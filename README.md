# Razorpay Website Clone

A project where I cloned the frontend part of the official Razorpay website using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me learn various styling concepts and allowed me to recreate the UI with precision.

## Overview

In this project, I aimed to replicate the frontend of the official Razorpay website. By using HTML and Tailwind CSS, I gained hands-on experience with web development and advanced styling techniques. This project allowed me to improve my UI design skills, understand responsive web design, and practice building web pages that closely resemble the original website.
